## Basic Usage

This repo is configured to have the following additonal branches

* container-pass
* container-fail
* iac-pass
* iac-fail

**(main branch not shown here)**

1. Each branch has a text file in the root of the branch with the same name referred to here as `branch-file.txt`.

2. To make code PRs easier you can simply modify the text in the `branch-file.txt` to get a code change to submit.
